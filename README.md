A Gameboy / Gameboy color emulator written in Kotlin.

## Can I use this emulator to play?
There are a lot more capable emulators available. 
This is a work in progress personal project with the aim for me to learn about emulation.

## Downloads

Make sure you have JDK8 installed.
After cloning the repository, simply use the gradle wrapper.

## Tests
